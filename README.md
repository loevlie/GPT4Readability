GPT4Readability is a powerful tool designed to automatically generate a comprehensive README.md file and suggest code improvements for any Python code repository. With its advanced AI capabilities, GPT4Readability goes beyond surface-level interpretation, allowing it to establish connections between disparate parts of code and gain an in-depth understanding of the code's functionality, structure, and intent.  

> Other than this sentence this readme file and this [suggestions file](https://github.com/loevlie/GPT4Readability/blob/main/suggestions.md) were both generated by GPT4Readability using gpt-3.5-turbo.  Any other changes made will be listed below:

* I added the version (0.0.5) to the installation section.
* UPDATE: README generation (suggestions coming soon!) is now integrated into [Huggingface Spaces 🤗](https://huggingface.co/spaces) using [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio).

## Features

- Automatic generation of a detailed README.md file for your Python codebase
- Suggestions for code improvements to enhance readability and maintainability

## Installation

To use GPT4Readability, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can install GPT4Readability and its dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install GPT4Readability==0.0.5
```

## Usage

GPT4Readability provides two main functionalities: README generation and code improvement suggestions. You can choose to use either one or both of these functions.

### README Generation

To generate a README.md file for your codebase, use the following command:

```bash
gpt4readability <path> --function readme --output_readme README.md --model <model>
```

Replace `<path>` with the path to your codebase directory and `<model>` with the desired model to use (either "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4").

### Code Improvement Suggestions

To generate code improvement suggestions for your codebase, use the following command:

```bash
gpt4readability <path> --function suggestions --output_suggestions suggestions.md --model <model>
```

Replace `<path>` with the path to your codebase directory and `<model>` with the desired model to use (either "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4").
